            <h2>Meaning of my name</h2>
            <p>My name, Christopher, carries profound significance as the bearer of Christus, symbolizing the presence of Christ in my heart wherever I go. It also translates to "The Consecrated." Similarly, Noah, the one who leads out of the flood, represents The Reassuring. My mom associates it with my calm demeanor as a baby, which has evolved into a person full of emotions and energy, maintaining a unique balance.</p>
            <h2>Who am I'</h2>
            <p>I define myself by my skills, showcasing what I can achieve based on my knowledge. Proficient in languages, coding, internet science, and mathematics, I exhibit discipline when passionately involved in something. My determination is unwavering, reflecting a commitment that nothing can deter when I'm genuinely interested.</p>
            <h2>Reputation/importance of my name'</h2>
            <p>My name is of paramount importance to me, representing my identity. I want it to evoke positive thoughts, mirroring who I truly am rather than conforming to others' expectations. Although I may change over time, the enduring essence of my name remains constant, embodying something good. It holds sentimental value, being the result of my parents' decision and fostering a deep emotional connection as I grew up with it.</p>
